		<p class="p">I am a junior <strong>Web developer</strong> and want to become a technology guru,mentor and teacher in the future. I came from a country where technology was non-existent and I am determined to share my technical expertise and knowledge with youth who will benefit from technological advances. I am passionate about creating websites and online applications that can teach, inform and transform people's lives. I enjoy the creative aspects of developing online tools and content as they allow you to use your knowledge and abilities to create that which doesn't necessarily exist yet.</p><br>
